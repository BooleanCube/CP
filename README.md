# Kattis
Hello, I am BooleanCube! I do competitive programming for my school team and as a hobby. One of the best practice websites in my opinion would be Kattis and they have a large amount of questions of all sorts of difficulties for all types of people and all sorts of problems.

I do Kattis almost everyday as a habit to get better at competitive programming and to keep the practice going. This is the repository where I will be uploading all my solutions to the Kattis problems I solve so I can both help people out and store these files somewhere.

My Goals: My goals for competitive programming with Kattis is that I start solving 7.0-9.0 difficulty questions easily by the time I reach senior year and my Kattis score should be atleast 600 pts.
