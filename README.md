# Competitive Programming
Hello, I am BooleanCube! I do competitive programming for my school team and as a hobby. One of the best practice websites in my opinion would be CSES or Codeforces. They have a large amount of questions of all sorts of difficulties for all types of people and all sorts of problems.

I do Competitive Programming almost every week as a habit to get better at competitive programming and to keep the practice going. This is the repository where I will be uploading all my solutions to the problems I solve so I can both help people out and store these files somewhere. If you click on a file, you can see that some of them are obviously incomplete, just file an issue and I will try to upload the right one, that goes for any other thing like Run Time Error or Time Limit Exceeded, etc.

Websites to practice in:

https://codeforces.com/ | 
https://cses.fi/problemset/ | 
https://leetcode.com/ | 
https://open.kattis.com/ | 
http://www.usaco.org/index.php | 
https://atcoder.jp/

*If you click on the commits you can see some commits are actually problems and once you click on a certain problem you will get a link to the problem an and solution or wip solution right under it.*

Goals:
- USACO Gold
- 1500+ Codeforces rating
- 100 Tasks on CSES
